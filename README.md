# Usebook
Android Project

This is an application that can trade used books.  
I refered to part of functions of "everytime" application.  
[everytime homepage]: <http://everytime.kr/>

I started the personal project for practice in October, 2017. And I am slowly doing this when I have some spare time.
I finished my work in September, 2018.

I used "Android Studio" tool and the application is based on "Firebase".

When I revise codes or add functions, I will update here.

You can see my project video through Youtube.
