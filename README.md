# Usebook
Android Project

This is an application that can trade used books.  
I refered to part of functions of "everytime" application.  
[everytime homepage]: <http://everytime.kr/>

I started the personal project for practice in October. And I am slowly doing this when I have some spare time.  
I think I have done about 80% progess so far. (March 4th, 2018)

I used "Android Studio" tool and the application is based on "Firebase".

When I revise codes or add functions, I will update here.
